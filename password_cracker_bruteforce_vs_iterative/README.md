# PYTHON PASSWORD CRACKER #

This project demonstrates two password-cracking techniques in Python:
- **Brute force**: randomly guessing passwords.
- **Iterative**: trying all possible combinations in order using `itertools.product`.

It roughly estimates the number of attempts per second and calculates how long it would take to crack a password based on user input.
